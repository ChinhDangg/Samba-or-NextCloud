## Next-Cloud
### Pretty cool with web interace for browser access and NextCloud's own app for mobile connection.
### Although still lacks some wanted features like subfolders searching and save searching (to prevent re-search after viewing).
### Also needed some configuration for videos thumbnail preview.
### NextCloud's app also doesn't support WEBP viewing unless viewing on the browser.

## Samba
### Just pure samba file-sharing protocol server.
### Worked well with File Manager+ that has subfolder searching and save searching and thumbnail preview.
### No good desktop application to view content temporary in ram. Cyberduck requires full download to view - waiting for MountainDuck SMB support.
